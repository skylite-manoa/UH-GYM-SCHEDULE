      <p>UHM Gym Schedule System is a Meteor scheduling application for the University of Hawaii community. A user
        will simply select the time they wish to go to the gym and it will appear on a calendar for that user to see.
        You can also add contact information to keep track of your fellow gym goers.</p>
